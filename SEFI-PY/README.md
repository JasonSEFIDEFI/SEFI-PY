# SEFI‑PY: Single Entity Field Interpretation (Python Core)

SEFI‑PY is a geometric field engine that models a single entity’s identity, autonomy, and dynamic behavior as a layered field. It is the Python implementation of SEFI (Single Entity Field Interpretation), designed to be structurally parallel to SEFI‑JS and suitable for research, simulation, and extension.

## Time manuscript dynamics — Jason D. Dutton

The [Time dynamics module](core/time_dynamics.py) adds the classical identity equations, directed clock phase, linear and nonlinear stability calculations, exact recurrence certificates, Floquet analysis, and the DNA penalty energy distinction from the submitted Time manuscript. See the [mathematical scope and reproduction guide](docs/TIME_DYNAMICS.md). These are conditional model results, not empirical validation.

Run `python demo_time_dynamics.py` for the manuscript examples and `python -m pytest tests/test_time_dynamics.py` for verification. The new module requires only the Python standard library.

## Core Concept

An entity is represented as a **field** with layered interpretation:

- **FIELD ORIGIN** — raw geometric state (position, momentum)
- **FIELD AUTHORSHIP** — expressed identity derived from origin
- **FIELD SOVEREIGNTY** — autonomous persistence and self‑governance
- **WARP:EXPRESSION** — dynamic expression of the sovereign field
- **WARP:DEFI** — Dynamic Entity Field Integration (active manipulation of the field)

Each layer is geometric, minimal, and stable, and each builds directly on the previous.

- Simulation engine with:
  - geometric evolution
  - behavioral layer
  - multi-entity interaction
  - environment forces
  - DNA identity configuration

- Full test suite

## Run Simulation

## Render a PowerPoint Video

The presentation runner renders the canonical narrative sequence and assembles a single PowerPoint-ready 16:9 MP4 at 1920x1080 and 30 fps:

```powershell
.\render_presentation.ps1
```

The final video is written to `animations/presentation/SEFI-boardroom.mp4`. Use a fast half-resolution preview while iterating:

```powershell
.\render_presentation.ps1 -Preview
```

To render another scene, pass its source file and class name:

```powershell
.\render_presentation.ps1 core/animations/sefi_core.py SEFICore
```

To render one scene in isolation, pass its source file and class name:

```powershell
.\render_presentation.ps1 core/animations/sefi_core.py SEFICore
```

The assembled MP4 and individual clips are saved in `animations/presentation`. Insert `SEFI-boardroom.mp4` into PowerPoint as a video.
